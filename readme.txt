JSJ Code Highlight automatically turns all your code into beautifully formatted snippets.

== Description ==

JSJ Code Highlight is a simple syntax highlighter for all your WordPress code snippets. The plugin includes four visual themes to enchance the look and feel of your code. These themes (taken form Highlight.js) have been enhanced for a more contemporary feel.

Above all the plugin aims to be simple and intuitive. Rather than bloating the plugin with features, the plugin has only a small set of carefully curated options to maximize simplicity and ease-of-use.

The plugin includes the ability to:

* Choose from a variety of themes
* Choose from various mono-spaced typefaces
* Add line numbers to your code automatically
* Activate tab replacement for your code
